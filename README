Squid Proxy List Editor
-----------------------
NB: Still in Development.
Writing lists to file is working but is yet to be tested on a production server with Squid running.

These scripts were set up and tested with PHP v5.4.6, MySQL 5.5.29


Setup
-----------------------
Create the database using setup-database.sql

Symlink the access lists to your web directory.
eg.
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 28 Feb 22 08:53 allowedsites.txt -> /etc/squid3/allowedsites.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 28 Feb 22 08:53 blockedsites.txt -> /etc/squid3/blockedsites.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 29 Feb 22 08:53 exceptedsites.txt -> /etc/squid3/exceptedsites.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 29 Feb 22 08:53 prioritysites.txt -> /etc/squid3/prioritysites.txt

Your database and path locations added to ple_config.php.
Your own username, hash and salt added/changed in login.php

ToDo
-----------------------
Security needs to be considered further.
Test in live environment
Test cross browser (have tested in IE 8, Ubuntu Firefox v19 and Chromium)
